      <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
      <p>
        As a 19-year-old programming student at university of Caucasus, I am
        passionate about harnessing technology to solve real-world problems. But
        first need a strong foundation in programming languages and a commitment
        to continuous learning. I am particularly interested in web development
        and data analysis, and I am excited about the opportunity to grow
        oneself profesionally.
